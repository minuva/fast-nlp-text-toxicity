# Fast text toxicity classification

An efficient open-source text toxicity classification system built on FastAPI ðŸš€. It uses a compact and accurate model running on onnxruntime for rapid CPU-based processing. It is an ideal solution for applications requiring fast and reliable toxicity classification without the need for GPU hardware. More details about the model in the [model page](https://huggingface.co/minuva/MiniLMv2-toxic-jigsaw-lite).

This project functions as the backend supporting the  [toxicity plugin](https://github.com/minuva/ph-toxicity-plugin) designed for use with [PostHog-LLM](https://github.com/postlang/posthog-llm).


# Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minuva/fast-nlp-text-toxicity.git
cd fast-nlp-text-toxicity
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Run locally

Run the following command to start the server (from the root directory):

```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```

Check `config.py` for more configuration options.


# Run with Docker

Run the following command to start the server (the root directory):

```bash
docker build --tag toxic .
docker run --network=postlang --network-alias=toxicity -p 9612:9612 -it toxic
```
The network and the network alias are used to allow PostHog-LLM to communicate with the toxicity classification service.
Since PostHog-LLM is running in a docker container, we connect the two services by adding them to the same network for *fast* and *reliable* communication.


# Example call
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:9612/conversation_toxicity_plugin' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "llm_input": "this is pure trash",
  "llm_output": "hello"
}'
```
