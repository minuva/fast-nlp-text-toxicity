# Fast text toxicity classification

An efficient open-source text toxicity classification system built on FastAPI ðŸš€. It uses a compact and accurate model running on onnxruntime for rapid CPU-based processing. It is an ideal solution for applications requiring fast and reliable toxicity classification without the need for GPU hardware. More details about the model in the [model page](https://huggingface.co/minuva/MiniLMv2-toxic-jigsaw-lite).
